# Hadoop

## What is Hadoop

Scenario: In a farm, Jack harvests grapes then stores produce in a storage shed. As there was a high demand for other fruits, Jack started harvesting apples and oranges as well. Jack can't do all the work himself, so he hires 2 more people to harvest, so that harvesting is done simultaneously. Now the storage room becomes a bottleneck, so Jack decides to distribute the storage area and give the fruits their own storage.

## The Rise of Big Data
- Earlier with limited data, only one processor and one storage unit was needed.
- Soon, data generation increased leading to high volume of data long with different data formats:
  - **Structured**: database (schema) rows and columns.
  - **Semi-structured**: Email, XML, HTML.
  - **Unstructured**: Binaries (pngs, mp3s).
- The solution was to use distributed storage for each processor. This enabled easy access to store and access data. This is known as parallel processing with distributed storage.

## What is Big Data
- Massive amount of data which cannot be stored, processed and analyzed using traditional methods.
  - Volume (capacity)
  - Velocity (streaming, multiple computers)
  - Variety (different types of input)
  - Value (data needs to be reduced down to value for stakeholders, and reduce it down so that people can use the data)
  - Veracity (data has a lot of uncertainty)
