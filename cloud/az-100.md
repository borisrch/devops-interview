# 2. Cloud Concepts

## 2.1 What is Cloud Computing?
- Definition: The practise of using a network fo remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer.
  - Local refers to on-premise where you own the servers, infrastructure, risk (i.e. your own data center).
  - Cloud providers refer to where someone else (the provider) owns the servers, infrastructure, and risk.
    - You are left with configuring cloud services and code.

### Dedicated Servers
- **One physical machine** dedicated to a single business. Runs a single web-app/site.
- Very expensive, high maintenance, however you have a greater level of security/configuration (depending on use-case).

### Virtual Private Servers
- **One physical machine** dedicated to a single business. 
  - The physical machine is virtualized into sub-machines which runs multiple web-apps/sites.

### Shared Hosting
- **One physical machine** shared by hundreds of businesses, relies on most tenants under-utilizing their resources (e.g. Wordpress).
  - Very cheap, but a lot of limitations.

### Cloud Hosting
- **Multiple physical machines** that act as one system. The system is abstracted into multiple cloud services.
  - This model is flexible, scalable, secure, cost-effective and highly configurable.

## 2.2 Common Cloud Services
- A cloud provider can have hundreds of cloud services that are grouped into various types. The 4 most common types of cloud services for Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) would be:
  - Compute: a virtual machine that can run applications, programs and code.
  - Storage: virtual hard-drives that you can store files/data.
  - Networking: virtual network being able to define connections or isolate networks.
  - Databases: virtual databases for storing data for applications.

## 2.3 What is Azure
- Microsoft calls their cloud provider service Microsoft Azure.
  - Azure means bright blue colour of the cloudless sky.
- Cloud service providers can be initialized to CSPs.

## 2.4 Benefits of Cloud Computing
- **Cost-effective**: you pay for what you consume, no up-front cost. Pay as you go (PAYG) with thousands of customers sharing the cost of resources.
- **Global**: Launch workloads *anywhere in the world*, just choose a region.
- **Secure**: Cloud provider takes care of physical security. Cloud services can be secure by default, or you have ability to configure access down to the granular level.
- **Reliable**: data backups, data recovery, and data replication, and fault tolerance.
- **Scalable**: increase or decrease resources and services based on demand.
- **Elastic**: automate scaling during spikes and drop in demand.
- **Current**: Underlying hardware and managed software is patched, upgraded and replaced by the CSP without interruption to you (or fewer than you would have vs. on-premise).

## 2.5 Types of Cloud Computing
- **SaaS**: a product that is run and managed by the service provider.
  - No concern on how the service is maintained, only that it works and remains available.
  - e.g. Salesforce, Office 365, Gmail
- **PaaS**: focus on development, deployment and management of your applications.
  - Don't worry about provisioning, configuration, or hardware/OS.
  - Mostly for developers that are building apps and not concerned for the underlying infrastructure.
  - e.g. Elastic Beanstalk (AWS), Heroku, Google App Engine.
- **IaaS**: basic building blocks for cloud, provides access to networking features, computers and data storage space.
  - No concern for IT staff, data centers, and hardware.
  - e.g. Microsoft Azure, AWS, Oracle Cloud.

## 2.6 Types of Cloud Computing Responsibiltiies
- **CSP** - Cloud Service Provider is responsible.
- **C** - Customer is responsible.

| Layer | On Premise | IaaS | PaaS | SaaS |
|-------|------------|------|------|------|
| Application | C | C | C | CSP |
| Data | C | C | C | CSP |
| Runtime | C | C | CSP | CSP |
| Middleware | C | C | CSP | CSP |
| OS | C | C | CSP | CSP |
| Virtualization | C | CSP | CSP | CSP |
| Servers | C | CSP | CSP | CSP |
| Storage | C | CSP | CSP | CSP |

- SaaS provides customers with the least responsibilty.
- On-premise provides customers with the most responsibility.

## 2.7 Azure Deployment Models
- **Public Cloud**: Everything built on the CSP (i.e. Cloud-Native).
  - Most cost-effective. Security controls by default but might not meet security requirements. Configuration limited. No need in-depth knowledge of underlying infrastructure.
- **Private Cloud**: Everything built on company's data centers. 
  - e.g. uses open-source cloud software: OpenStack. 
  - Most expensive. Security is managed by the owner, and can meet any security compliance requirement. Configuration to how you like. Need to know in-depth knowledge in all levels of infrastructure.
- **Hybrid**: Uses both On-Premise and CSP.
  - Could be more cost-effective based on what you offload to the cloud. Can meet security requirements. Best of both worlds, however you need to know how to configure levels of infrastructure and know CSP services.

## 2.8 Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)
- On-Premise may have a lot of hidden costs (physical security hardware, IT personnel, maintenance).
- Cloud has subscription fees, but less hidden costs.
- Generalized to **75% savings** moving from On-Premise to Cloud.

## 2.9 Capital vs. Operational Expenditure
- CAPEX: Spending money upfront on physical infrastructure. Deducting that expense from your tax bill over time.
  - Sever, storage, network (routers, cable, switches), backup and archive costs.
- OPEX: The cost associated with an on-premise data center that has shifted to the CSP. Customers are now concerned with the non-physical costs.
  - Leasing software, training software, paying for cloud support, billing based on cloud usage.

## 2.10 Cloud Architecture Terminology
- Availability: The amount of time the network is up and running.
  - High Availability (HA).
- Scalability: The ability to increase network capacity as demand increases, and the ability to reduce network capacity when demand decreases.
  - Similar to Elasticity
- Performance: The quantity of bits sent and received per second.
- Fault Tolerance: The ability to prevent a failure.
- Disaster Recovery - The ability to recover from a failure.

## 2.11 High Availability
- The ability for your service to remain available by ensuring there is no single point of failure and/or ensure a certain level of performance.
  - e.g. Run several redundant servers behind a load balancer (Azure Load Balancer).
- Having servers in different data centers will also provide redundancy in the event that a data center becomes unavailable.
- **Availability Zones** are abstracted as servers in a data center. Having workload across multiple availabiltiy zones ensures that your services/applicaitons remain available.
- **Load Balancer** allows you to evenly distribute traffic to multiple servers in one or more data centers.
  - LBs can route traffic using round-robin, or based on specific metrics e.g. % CPU usage.
  - LBs are smart enough to know that if a server is not healthy (e.g. does not respond to a health-check ping), future requests will not be routed there.
